Given an integer n, produce a two-dimensional array
of size (n√ón) and complete it according to the following
rules, and print with a single space between characters:

    On the main diagonal write 0 .
    On the diagonals adjacent to the main, write 1 .
    On the next adjacent diagonals write 2 and so forth.

Print the elements of the resulting array.
